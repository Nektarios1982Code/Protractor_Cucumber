PACKAGE.JSON WITH DEPENDENCIES
------------------------------
Your package.json file should now look like this:
```
{
  "name": "protractor_cucumber",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {

    "properties-reader": "^1.0.0",
    "protractor": "^5.4.3",
    "protractor-cucumber-framework": "^6.2.0"
  }
}
```

CONFIGURATION FILE v1.0.0
-------------------------
Add on your project ROOT folder the file protractor-conf.js

The basic skeleton should look like this:

```
exports.config = {
    //directConnect: true,
    seleniumAddress: 'http://localhost:4444/wd/hub',
    framework: 'custom',
    frameworkPath: require.resolve('protractor-cucumber-framework'),
    capabilities: {
        'browserName': 'chrome'
    },
    specs: ['protractor-specs.js']
};
```

PROTRACTOR SPECS FILE 
---------------------
Add on your project ROOT folder the file protractor-specs.js

which will contain a basic test of protractor without cucumber yet

```
describe('angularjs homepage todo list', function () {
    it('should add a todo', function () {
        browser.get('https://angularjs.org');
    });
});
```

PACKAGE.JSON WITH SCRIPTS
-------------------------
In your package.json file add on the scripts section the following lines:

The protractor line points to the protactor cmd file and the argument

passed is the specs file we have added before.

```
 "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "protractor": ".\\node_modules\\.bin\\protractor.cmd protractor-conf.js"
  },
```

RUN OUR FIRST PROTRACTOR SCRIPT
-------------------------------
Open 2 terminals or cmd windows and leave them open in order to keep running the processes below:
Go to your 1st terminal or cmd and type from your project's folder the following commands:

1. webdriver-manager update

This will download all required webdrivers for our browsers

2. webdriver-manager start

This will start the webdriver manager in order to successfully receive browser requests for connection

From a 2nd terminal or cmd window run the following command :

3. npm run protractor

This command will automatically run the script with property 'protractor', defined in the package.json
